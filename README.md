</p>

<br/>

- Let's make **wisdom** from knowledge.
- Define concepts to be intuitively understandable.
    * Simply summary (You can check the details on Wiki)
    * With `story` or example
    * Draw an `illustration`
    * If possible, append a `code`
- Documentation by [Gitbook](https://humanbrain.gitbook.io/notes/)

## Usage

- Sync papers (* recommend path like Google Drive's sync folder) 
 
```
python scripts/sync_papers.py {SYNC_PATH}
```

- Make `SUMMARY.md`

```
python scripts/make_summary.py
```
