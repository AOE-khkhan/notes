Logic

- Certainty: Math
- Uncertainty: Probability (numerical representation of uncertainty)

### Naive definitnio of Probability

- A <U>sample space</U> is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
- An <U>event</U> is a <U>subset</U> of the sample space.

\* The concept of a set: to think of probabilities as mathematics.  
\* Probability is not intuitive.

P(A) = # favorable outcomes A / # possible outcomes  
(A = event)

Assumes: all outcomes equally likely finite sample space.
 
### Counting Principle

- Multiplication Rule: it have experiment with n, possible outcomes, and for each outcomes of 1st experiment there are outcomes for 2nd experiemnt, ..., for each n_r ... n_1, n_2, ..., n_r overall possible outcomes

### Binomial Coefficient

Subsets of size k, of groups of n people.
