## Simple Summary

> In recent years, there has been a explosion in the amount of text data from a variety of sources. This volume of text is an invaluable source of information and knowledge which needs to be effectively summarized to be useful. In this review, the main approaches to automatic text summarization are described. We review the different processes for summarization and describe the effectiveness and shortcomings of the different methods.

- `Summary`: a text that is produced from one or more texts, that conveys important information in the original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s) and usually, significantly less than that.

- Methods to determine the sentence weight: (1950s)
	1. Cue Method: based on presence or absence of words in the continuous unified electornic(cue) dictionary.
	2. Title Method: sum of all the content words appearing in the title and headings of a text.
	3. Location Method: individual paragraphs have a higher probability of being relevant.

- Approaches for automatic summarization:
	- `Extractiion`: identifying important sections of the text and generating them verbatim.
	- `Abstractive`: interpret and examine the text using advanced natural language techniques in order to generate a new shorter text.
		- cope with problems such as semantic representation, inference and natural language generation.

	- `topic representation`: transform the text into an intermediate representation and interpret the topic(s) discussed in the text.
	- `indicator representation`: describe every 
2. Score the sentences based on the representation.
